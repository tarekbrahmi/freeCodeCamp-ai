# Machine Learning with Python

Machine learning has many practical applications that you can use in your projects or on the job.

In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the **TensorFlow** framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.

# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the boilerplate for the Rock Paper Scissors project.

# Book Recommendation with KNN

# Cat and Dog Classification

Classify images of dogs and cats using Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time.

# Health Costs Prediction with Regression

Predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.

# SMS text Classification

Creating a machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
